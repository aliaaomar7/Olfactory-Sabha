## This project was completed as part of the "Introduction to Computational Neuroscience" summer course by Arab Neuroscience. 
The focus of the project is on building a classification model for motor imagery using (EEG) recorded signals, a technique used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).
## Objectives:
Investigate the activity of specific EEG electrodes that are closely correlated to actual or imagined hands movement.
Build a model able to perform classification between left and right hand movement.
Build a model able to classify between either left or right motor imagery and rest state
Build model able to classify between actual and imaginary hand movements, for example (left MI) and (left real)
## Data 
Total Recordings: 1,500+ EEG recordings (1-2 minutes each)
Participants: 109 volunteers
64-channel EEG were recorded using the BCI2000 system 
 subject performed 14 experimental runs:
Baseline, eyes open
Baseline, eyes closed
Task 1 (open and close left or right fist)
Task 2 (imagine opening and closing left or right fist)
Task 3 (open and close both fists or both feet)
Task 4 (imagine opening and closing both fists or both feet)
Repetition: Each task type is repeated 3 times
